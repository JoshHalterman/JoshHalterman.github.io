        <h1>Josh Halterman's Portfolio</h1>

        <div id="intro">
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>I'm a software developer with 3 years of experience in QA testing. I have strong technical skills and experience with testing and provisioning workflows, as well as a bachelor's degree in computer science.</p>
          <p>As a student, I worked with a variety of programming languages and tools. While working with Cognizant, as a contractor with Cox Communications, I gained experience with test planning methodologies, leading the execution of test plans, and performing defect triage support after signoff. I worked across multiple teams and multiple testing stacks, and have experience with design spec analysis and test case estimation.</p>
          <p>During my time with Cognizant, I've also taken opportunities for additional trainings and certifications, including Microsoft AZ-900.</p>
